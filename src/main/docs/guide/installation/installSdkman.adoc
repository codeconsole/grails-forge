The best way to install Grails on Unix systems is with http://sdkman.io/[SDKMAN] which greatly simplifies installing
and managing multiple Grails versions.

Before updating make sure you have latest version of SDKMAN installed. If not, run

[source,bash]
----
$ sdk update
----

In order to install Grails, run following command:

[source,bash]
----
$ sdk install grails
----

You can also specify the version to the `sdk install` command.

[source,bash,subs="attributes"]
----
$ sdk install grails {project-version}
----

You can find more information about SDKMAN usage on the http://sdkman.io/usage[SDKMAN Docs]

You should now be able to run the Grails CLI.

[source,bash]
----
$ grails
| Starting interactive mode...
| Enter a command name to run. Use TAB for completion:
grails>
