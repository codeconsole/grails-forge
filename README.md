Generates Grails applications.

## Installation

The CLI application comes in various flavours from a universal Java applications to native applications for Windows, Linux and OS X. These are available for direct download on the [releases page](https://github.com/grails/grails-forge/releases). For installation see the [Grails documentation](https://docs.grails.org/latest/guide/index.html#buildCLI).

If you prefer not to install an application to create Micronaut applications you can do so with `curl` directly from the API:

```bash
$ curl https://forge.grails.org/demo.zip -o demo.zip
$ unzip demo.zip -d demo
$ cd demo
$ ./gradlew run
```

Run `curl https://forge.grails.org` for more information on how to use the API or see the API documentation referenced below.

## UI

If you prefer a browser based user interface you can visit [Grails Forge](https://start.grails.org).

The user interface is [written in React](https://github.com/grails/grails-forge-ui/tree/main/app/launch) and is a static single page application that simply interacts with the https://start.grails.org API.
